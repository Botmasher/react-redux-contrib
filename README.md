# Getting into the React, Redux, React Native Open Source communities

## What is this?
This is a place for me to keep notes and sample code as I go from React+Redux user to contributor. I'll start here with general info and links. If I find a good way to organize the information as I go along, I will consider creating a more interactive project.

## Projects
Check out the libraries on GitHub:
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

Browse the open issues for relevant projects:
- [react issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues), well labeled, coded for difficulty (including "beginner")
- [react-native issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues), well labeled, including "Good First Task"
- [redux issues](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues), sometimes labeled, may have a number marked "help wanted"
- [react-redux issues](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues), sometimes labeled, may include some "help wanted"
- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues), sometimes labeled, may include some "help wanted"

Facebook also has a page dedicated to [its current projects](https://code.facebook.com/projects/).
