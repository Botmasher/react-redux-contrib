# Getting into the React, Redux, React Native Open Source communities

## What is this?
This is a place for me to keep notes and sample code as I go from React+Redux user to contributor. I'll start here with general info and links. If I find a good way to organize the information as I go along, I will consider creating a more interactive project.

## Projects
Check out the libraries on GitHub:
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

Browse the open issues for relevant projects:
- [react issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues), well labeled, coded for difficulty (including "beginner")
- [react-native issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues), well labeled, including "Good First Task"
- [redux issues](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues), sometimes labeled, may have a number marked "help wanted"
- [react-redux issues](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues), sometimes labeled, may include some "help wanted"
- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues), sometimes labeled, may include some "help wanted"

Facebook also has a page dedicated to [its current projects](https://code.facebook.com/projects/).

## Feedback from helpful people

### October 10, 2017
In the Udacity React Slack #office-hours channel I asked, "Thanks for all the hard work on the course! Any tips or info for someone who'd like to contribute to Open Source projects within the React community?" I got these helpful responses:

Thanks for the feedback @languagejosh! We definitely appreciate it.
In terms of tips for working on open-source projects, I'd start off by reading the README. They sometimes might have a section on contributions, or even an entire document in the repo that discusses some guidelines and expectations.

Before working on anything though, definitely check out existing issues or even review pull requests to see what's being worked on. You might even want to open an issue to check in with people maintaining the code for areas of opportunity

Make sure you're feeling good and strong with your version control skills, too:
* Version Control w/ Git https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123
* GitHub & Collaboration https://www.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456

Separately, here was some feedback in another thread about getting into new projects and sharpening skills:

What really helped for me the first time I learned React (and Redux) was just taking an existing app that I liked, then building a clone of it. 
You don't need to have a fully-featured carbon copy. Just re-create the main functionality of that app.
For example, let's say you're recreating TaskRabbit. Features I'd absolutely include would be:
- Selecting a task from some index
- Providing details for that task
- Selecting a price and scheduling/confirming
- Be assigned a user for a particular task

## Contributing guides
- React is under "very active development", so please read up on [how to contribute](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html), the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [sign your CLA](https://code.facebook.com/cla) before contributing
- For React Native, read up on how to get involved starting with the [contributing guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/contributing.html) and then select a [good first task](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/Good%20First%20Task)
- For Redux, start with [the CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Codes of conduct
- the Facebook Open Source community has a [code of conduct](https://code.facebook.com/pages/876921332402685/open-source-code-of-conduct)
- Redux has a contributor covenant [code of conduct](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
